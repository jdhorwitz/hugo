## Welcome!!!



I am a passionate Javascript developer currently living and working in Ann Arbor, MI.

I used to hate Javascript. I used to hate front end, and I still at times hate CSS.  I never
thought that front end development was a direction for me so just let me handle services
and leave me alone.

This all changed when I was exposed to ES6 as well as React.  There was something about the 
changes made to Javascript as well as the paradigm promoted by React that just clicked in 
my brain.  Since then, the backend has been my backend (Pardon my punning - (Ocaml wordplay.)).

Ocaml was always a language that I have played around with and it always seemed to strike a
chord with me as a developer.  Like ES6 and React, it fit my mind.  OOP and Java and interfaces
upon interfaces upon interfaces never really clicked in my brain.  Ocaml scratched an itch
and I fell in love with it.

When I found out that some of the brilliant minds at Facebook were not only using Ocaml, but
were also developing a tooling and syntax on top of it (ReasonML) I knew that was the 
direction I wanted to go.

I'll walk you through how I learned ReasonML, Ocaml and Bucklescript as well as the random
React and Javascript thoughts as they come.
